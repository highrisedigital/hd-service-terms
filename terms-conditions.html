				<p>The following document covers the terms and conditions for Highrise Digital Ltd, this website, our other online services such as our <a href="https://store.highrise.digital">store</a> and all Highrise Digital customer projects.</p>

				<p>These terms and conditions layout, in as simple language as we can, our expectations. They are intended to protect you and us from anything unexpected happening when we are working together.</p>

				<p>For the purposes of these terms and conditions, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to Highrise Digital Ltd., and “you” and “your” refers to you or the organisation that you represent.</p>

				<h2>1. Privacy</h2>

				<p>We have a separate <a href="https://highrisedigital.github.io/hd-service-terms/privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a>, as well as a cookie policy which should be read in conjunction with the information below. This privacy information applies to Highrise Digital Ltd customers, visitors and users of this website and users of all our other online services.</p>

				<p>Should you choose to comment on the articles on the Highrise Digital website, we collect some private information including your name, email address and should you choose to enter it, your website URL. Your email address will always be kept private, however, should your comment be published, your name will be displayed next to the comment. You should only provide information in a comment that you are happy to be published on the internet. Highrise Digital will always have the last word to approve or not approve a comment for any reason.</p>

				<h2>2. Hosting</h2>

				<p>This information on hosting applies to any Highrise Digital customers that host a website with us:</p>

				<p>2.1. We do not host your website on servers owned and operated by us. Instead we re-sell hosting from larger companies. As a consequence, these larger hosting companies have their own terms and conditions, terms of use as well as other legal documents. These will be provided to you (or links to them) when you host with us. You must accept these documents in order to host with us.</p>

				<p>2.2. Of course we will try to keep your site up and running at all times however we cannot guarantee that your site will always be online. This is because we are subject to the availability of our hosting provider and we can accept no liability for losses that may be incurred as a result of your website being offline or failing.</p>

				<p>2.3. Although Highrise Digital do keep a backup of your site hosted with us, this backup cannot be guaranteed to be available at any point in time. Therefore you are responsible for taking backups of the sites you host with us and you agree that you will carry out your own backup routines on any site you host with us. Highrise Digital is not responsible for any data that is lost or damaged. We can help you with setting up a backup service should you wish us to do so.</p>

				<p>2.4. Our hosting services should not be used to host anything illegal or offensive. If you need clarification on examples of this then please let us know. If it is deemed that you are hosting such content, your site will be immediately suspended, and we are not responsible for any loss of data that could happen.</p>

				<p>2.5. Under the terms of the GDPR, it requires that you, as a data controller for the content you host, enter into a data processing agreement with us. By accepting these terms, you are also accepting <a href="https://highrisedigital.github.io/hd-service-terms/data-processing.html">our data processing agreement</a>.</p>

				<h2>3. Data, Designs and Backup</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>3.1. We always send project deliverables in an electronic format.</p>

				<p>3.2. We will keep copies of the code or designs that we have delivered to you and you agree to this, including allowing us to store this on whatever storage we deem necessary.</p>

				<p>3.3. You are responsible for making sure that your code, website or software is backed up and Highrise Digital are not liable for any data that is lost or damaged.</p>

				<h2>4. Copyright and Content</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>4.1. Usually we build our customer projects using software (<a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>) which is released under an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">open source license</a>. As a result of this, any derivative work we create for you means that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>You are free to use, copy and modify the work yourself</li>
					<li>You maintain the copyright of the work</li>
					<li>You are not required to release it to the public, but should you choose to do so, you must do so using the same license</li>
				</ul>

				<p>4.2. For any work that you create using our services you will own the copyright as much as is allowed.</p>

				<p>4.3 Any work that we create for you will be owned by you, and you will grant Highrise Digital Ltd an unlimited license to use, copy and modify the work as well as allowing Highrise Digital Ltd to base other works upon them. The reason for this is to allow us to re-use things we and built before rather than having to re-build everything from scratch each time.</p>

				<p>4.4. Any content uploaded to a site using our hosting must either be owned by you, licensed to you for use on your site or in the public domain and therefore free from copyright restrictions. Any content uploaded to hosting provided by us that is found to not have the relevant permissions wil be removed by either ourselves or our hosting company. We cannot accept any liability for costs as a result of content removal.</p>

				<h2>5. Data Processing Agreement</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>5.1. Many, if not most of the projects that we carry out require us to process some of your personal data for which you are the data controller. By accepting these terms you are also accepting our data processing agreement.</p>

				<h2>6. Technical Support</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>6.1. We are not perfect! and we sometimes don’t get everything correct. Therefore if you find a bug (something that is in scope and not working correctly) within 28 days of your project being delivered and assuming that the codebase to your project has not been altered since launch, please get in touch and we will endeavour to correct this as soon as is practically possible.</p>

				<p>6.2. We try our very best to make websites display on a wide range of modern devices and browsers. However we cannot be responsible when pages or content do not display on older out-of-date browsers. If you require support for a specific device and/or browser, please indicate this at the start of your project.</p>

				<h2>Portfolio Usage</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>7.1. We love to talk about, display and publish information about the work that we do with our clients. It often helps new customers make informed decisions about engaging with us. You therefore agree that we can display, publish and talk about the work that we do with you and this can be included in our portfolio on our website as well as published on our site in other ways we deem helpful e.g. a blog post about a particular project. We will of course never include any sensitive information in such portfolio items. If for some reason you do not want our relationship public, please let us know.</p>

				<p>7.2. We also include a small backlink to our website in the footer of websites we produce and you agree to keep this link present on your site. Again if this is a problem, please let us know.</p>

				<h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>

				<p>This section applies to all Highrise Digital customers.</p>

				<p>8.1. During our professional relationship we may give advice on software tools and other digital solutions. Although we are confident that we know about lots of useful tools we cannot guarantee that this advice is the best and most up-to-date. With this in mind we cannot therefore accept liability for any costs incurred by you that are caused by us providing you with such advice and information.</p>
